# pattern bases subsets
#Input [1,2,3,4, 5,8,9,11 , 18,22, 26, 30, 33, 36 39, 42, 43,50,57]
# Explanation 
# - location 0-3, the diff pattern is 1
# - location 6-7, diff pattern is 2
# - location 8-11, diff pattern is 4
# - location 12- 15 , pattern is 3 and so on

# Output -
# Subsets are [[1,2,3,4], [9, 11], [18, 22, 26, 30], [33, 36, 39, 42], [43, 50, 57]]
